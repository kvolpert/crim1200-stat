VARIABLE TYPES:

Categorical — usually strings, identify which category something falls into 
  Ordinal — ordered categorical variables (ex. education levels)
  Nominal — unordered
  Binary — 0 or 1, yes or no, 2 options
Quantitative — numbers
  Continuous — the values in between the values are relevant
  Discrete — the in between values don't matter

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS:

```{r, include = TRUE}

# Initial analysis
summary() # tells you the min, max, mean, median, and quartiles (only for quantitative)
table() 
# one variable tells you the count of each value (mostly used for categorical)
# two variables creates a contingency table 
prop.table(table()) # tells you the proportion of each value (mostly used for categorical)

# na.rm = T to exclude NAs in the calculations

# Center
median()
mean()

# Shape
# Modes — number of humps in the histogram
  # Unimodal = one
  # Bimodal = two 
  # Multimodal = multiple
  # Uniform = no peaks
# Symmetry
# Outliers
# Skew
  # Skewed right when the tail is on the right
  # Skewed left when the tail is on the left

# Spread
range()
sd() # standard deviation (units [average of the squared differences] from the mean)
var() # variance (the average of all data points in a group)
IQR() # quartiles

# If it's skewed data, don't use mean. Use median

```

TYPES OF ANALYSIS FOR DIFFERENT VARIABLE TYPES:

- One Quantitative variable
    - visual —> histrogram or boxplot
    - descriptions —> min, max, median, mean, mode, IQR, standard deviation
- Two quantitative variables
    - visual ——> scatterplot
    - descriptions —>
- One categorical variable
    - visual —> bar chart, pie chart (but don't use this)
    - description —> frequency, counts, table(), percents
- Two categorical variable:
    - visual —> side by side barchart
    - description —> contingency table

GRAPHS:

```{r, include = TRUE}

install.packages("ggplot2")
library(gglot2) # always load the ggplot2 package

# Scatterplot
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = z)) +
  geom_point()

# color is the third variable

# Barplot
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = z)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")

# Histogram
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity")

# Boxplot
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_boxplot()

# Graph + Modifications
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = z)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Title") +
  xlab("X Axis Name") +
  ylab("Y Axis Name") + 
  theme_classic()

# Add facet_wrap

```

CORRELATIONS:

```{r, include = TRUE}

# Correlation
cor(x = x, y = y, method = "pearson")

# Correlation strengths guide
# 0.9-1.00: Very strong
# 0.7-0.9: High correlation
# 0.5-0.7: Moderate correlation
# 0.3-0.5: Low correlation
# 0.0-0.3: Negligible correlation

```

SAVE AN IMAGE:

```{r, include = TRUE}

# Save it in R Studio
ggsave("/Users/mariacuellar/Github/crim1200-stat/examplehistogram.png")
# Insert into Canvas

```
